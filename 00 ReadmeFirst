This project is to predict flight delays. 


This folder includes
    jupyter notebooks
    App folder with .py and html for the app
    Power Point presentation
    Dataset was larger than 3GB and is too large to be loaded to Github
    Hence notebooks will not run
    ***The Delay App can be run***

Documents are numbered from 01 to 06

001 Airlines Data Acquisition.ipynb is the notebook gathering data:
	Delay file from 2015 (Performance_2015.csv)
	Plane Characteristics (faa_tail_number_inquiry.jsonl)
    We also remove attributes with many nan and keep data we think can help:
	delays1.csv 
	tail1.csv (keeping 

002 Airlines Data Enrichment_SQL_Prep prepares our data to use in a model
	-1- We load our delays and tail files in an Amazon Postgres DB
	-2- We join the tables on tailnum
	-3- We keep only the columns that can become numeric and transform them
		to integer or float	
	-4- We create an intermediate files to use in our prediction models
		numeric_file.csv 
		numeric_file.p 
03 Airlines Delay Prediction Models contains various analysis performed
	-1- Logistic regression model is saved in "savelogreg.p"
	-2- Random Forest
	-3- Neural Network
	-4- Attempt on SVM linear

04 Airlines visualization data.ipynb
	Contains a few queries that generated files to be loaded in tableau
	not really interesting
	Tableau visuals appear in powerpoint presentation

05 Delay App folder contains the components of the app
	python main.py and copy address in chrome tab

06 mcnultyv3.pptx is the presentation document for the project



Happy reading !
