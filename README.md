# Predicting-Flights-Delays
Airplane Delay Analysis 

I have been flying a lot in my life and got interested to predict if a flight would be delayed or not.
This repository contains the the notebooks used to create and apply a logistics regression to predict if you will have delays at arrival or not. 

The accuracy of the model is 94.4% so I assume I did something right  ! 

Included are: Notebooks to process data, app to predict, presentation.
